# OpenPunk

This frontend source for [openpunk.com](https://openpunk.com). My `layouts/` holds my Go Template for the [hugo generator](https://gohugo.io), while the `content/` directory holds all of my blog, journal & writings for the site.

## Usage

Run a local copy of the site using:
```
$ hugo server
```

Then visit the site at [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/)

For details on how it's deployed to [openpunk.com](https://openpunk.com) on my end, checkout this [ansible-playbook](https://github.com/CPunch/openpunk-ansible).
