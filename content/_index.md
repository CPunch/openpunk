## A site about things

I [make](https://github.com/CPunch) and [break](/tags/reverse-engineering) software. An avid systems programmer with an emphasis on Unix philosophy & reverse engineer. Checkout my [blog](/pages) where I write about my projects mostly, also checkout my [journal](/journal) where I share various thoughts and opinions about things.
