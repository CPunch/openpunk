## A site about things

I sometimes "[make](https://github.com/CPunch) and [break](/tags/reverse-engineering)" things. An avid **systems programmer** with a love of **Unix philosophy**. Checkout my [blog](/pages) where I go in-depth on some of my projects or my [journal](/journal) where I ramble about various things :D

Any questions or concerns can be emailed to me at [cpunch@openpunk.com](mailto:cpunch@openpunk.com). I also have an [RSS feed](/index.xml) if you'd like to keep tabs on me :)

## Other sites about... other things!
Below is a small collection of sites of some people who I think are rad. If you've got your own blog/log/writings please reach out! I'd love to have you included :)
