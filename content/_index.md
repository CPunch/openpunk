## A site about things

Your average "[make](https://github.com/CPunch) and [break](/tags/reverse-engineering)"-er. An avid **systems programmer** with an emphasis on **Unix** philosophy.
> Artwork by [**@hsgrace**](https://hsgrace.tumblr.com)!

Some projects I'm proud of:
- [OpenFusion](https://github.com/OpenFusionProject/OpenFusion): FusionFall Server Emulator, relevant [post](/pages/fusionfall-openfusion)
- [Laika](https://github.com/CPunch/Laika): RAT written in modern C
- [Cosmo](https://github.com/CPunch/Cosmo): Embedded scripting language, inspired by Lua
