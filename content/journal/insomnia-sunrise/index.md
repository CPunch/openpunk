I found myself up at 6am, not being able to sleep. I hadn't been getting much sleep lately so this wasn't a surprising fact. Either way I found myself poking around google maps until I realized I lived quite close to a lake. Being 6am, I knew the sun would be rising in about an hour or so. Eager to get out of my apartment and for a mini adventure, I brewed myself some coffee and set out to Lake Ray Roberts to watch the sunrise.

This was my view:

> The wind was fairly strong this morning, leading to some nice waves :)
