Over the past years I've grown. A little bit at a time, sometimes painstakingly, but I've grown nonetheless. This is my official disclaimer that I am just some nerd in your computer that writes a blog about software I think is cool. I am just a CompSci student and nothing on this site should be taken as fact. Do your own exploration! Correct me when I'm wrong!

Learning a skill is a process. Everyone starts somewhere and when you're just starting out you think your breadth of knowledge is all that there is to know. I know I did sadly, and Iâ€™ll probably come back one day and look at where I am now and feel the same way. You will always be learning something new, this is probably just a fact of life.

Your goal should not be to "be an expert," instead it should be to ***always be learning***. Technology is insane! Only an insane person can know just a fraction of it all. It's both embarrassing and humbling to read older posts I wrote and realize "ah, yikes that's a horrible way to do that." Growth can be painful! Just remember you grew.

## Revising and improvements
I will be going through some older posts in the coming weeks and revising several of them. I don't think this is 'changing history' as you can always [clone my repository](https://github.com/CPunch/openpunk) and checkout a previous commit to view my ugly mistakes.
