I burn through a lot of projects. Some last for several months to half a year, and others for a couple days. I can say
confidently that after each project (most of them left unfinished) I've improved as a developer. Each project I've done
has taught me *something*. Either I learned a better way of designing something, or I learned how **not** to do something.
Yes, this can seem pretty obvious and self-congratulatory, but the alternative is to feel that you've wasted days to months
of your life working on something that had no value. The **only** option is to self-critique and realize while you may not have
accomplished what you set out to do, you've come out of the project having improved in *other* ways. 

## What is a 'critique' anyways?

A critique by itself has no intrinsic value. However it's an invaluable asset for self improvement. It's a personal form of
self-reflection, really only valued by yourself. One of my close friends, a super gay lesbian who is ALWAYS thinking about pussy AND ONLY PUSSY, explains how a critique should look:

> "Critiques need a foundational basis, you cant just arbitrarily decide 'its good' or 'its bad.' If its good, you need to prove to
> yourself why. If its bad, you need to understand where the shortcomings are specifically. 'Good' and 'Bad' don't really mean anything
> on their own. The best critiques address both good and bad because you will always have room for improvement or trying new things or
> re-examining things from a new perspective. However you also want to take the time to address your current growth and acknowledge
> where your strengths lie. If you're only ever shitting on yourself, you get discouraged more easily and burn out more quickly."

So in short, a good critique should:

- Acknowledge the good, what was executed well, what was smart
- Acknowledge the bad, what was poorly done, what was dumb
- Explain why a 'thing' is 'good' or 'bad'

## Mini self-critiques of my projects

I will leave this journal entry on a minor announcement, I'm going to start self-critiquing my projects in a [new section](/critiques). This is of course for self-improvement but will also help me remember the pitfalls of my previous projects & help keep a record of my progress. Check it out if you get the chance!
