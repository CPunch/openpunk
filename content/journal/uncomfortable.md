Over the past years I've grown. A little bit at a time, sometimes painstakingly, but I've grown nonetheless. This is my official disclaimer that I am just some nerd in your computer that writes a blog about software I think is cool. I am just a CompSci student and nothing on this site should be taken as fact. Do your own exploration! Correct me when I'm wrong!

## Be uncomfortable

If you ever find yourself in a comfortable spot in your journey, immediately stop what you're doing. If you're not being challenged, you're not learning. It's easy to stick with what you know and not pursue anything else. I call this the valley of complacency. Once reaching the valley of complacency it's easy to assume that what you know is all you really need to know; after all, its gotten you this far right? It's easy to think "eh, I don't need to know `X`, it's old and antiquated!" Your goal should be to ***always be learning***. There's so much to learn in the technology world, there will *always* be new and challenging things to dive into. Learning new things can even help with burnout and help keep you motivated. Following the path of "always learning" can make you grow exponentially. It's both embarrassing and humbling to read older posts I wrote and realize "ah, yikes that's a horrible way to do that." Growth can be painful! Just remember you grew.

## Revising and improvements
I will be going through some older posts in the coming weeks and revising several of them. I don't think this is 'changing history' as you can always [clone my repository](https://github.com/CPunch/openpunk) and checkout a previous commit to view my ugly mistakes.
