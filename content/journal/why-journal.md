I've come to the conclusion that I *enjoy* writing. Sad part is that I don't always have a clean presentable project to write a roughly 1000 word essay over. Thats where this journal comes in! Think of these as 'mini-blog' posts, short and sweet. I'm not going to try to make these as presentable as my blog posts, aka "I'm lazy and would like to write about small projects or opinions that wouldn't fit into a whole post." In the past I've refrained from posting opinion-related topics, however I am labeling my journal *my fucking journal*, opinions not excluded!

Hiring inquirers should maybe skip out on this section of my site. My opinions are liable to be wrong and full of first-world perspectives.
